I began my career working in a local computer repair store saving motherboards from wine spills and soldering long enough for the fumes to give me headaches. After graduating with an associates in CSS I began working as a Systems Engineer. After about 3 years of server and network administration, I took on a more devops associated role and have been building projects, programming, automation and CI/CD pipelines ever since.
